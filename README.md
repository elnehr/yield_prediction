# Predicting Rice Yields in India Using a Hierarchical Modelling Approach

In this repository, we demonstrate how to statistically predict crops yields using the example of rice yields in India. We predict the district level yield based on monthly solar radiation, temperature and precipitation as fixed effects, and with the districts as random effect.
